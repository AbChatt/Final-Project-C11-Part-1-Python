# Final Project C11
 A simple program that implements PCA, regression, cross validation on the oil500 dataset. The PCA coefficients are fed as inputs to the regression model (which can be linear or quadratic). Cross validation is used to verify the ideal subspace dimension to use as well as the dimension of the model
